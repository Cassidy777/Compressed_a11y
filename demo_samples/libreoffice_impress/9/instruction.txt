On it Whenever I launch a LibreOffice Impress, it uses both screens, one for current slide and next slide and another for actual presentation. What I want is to use only one monitor which shows presentation. I dont want the screen with Current slide and Next slide so that it can be used for other purposes. How should I achieve this?
